# Project Overview

LearnEase is a web-based academic assistant designed to make learning simple. Students can paste text, upload PDF notes, or type a topic. The system uses AI (OpenAI or Gemini model) to generate:

* ✔ Explanations
* ✔ Summaries
* ✔ Quiz Questions

It reduces study time and improves retention by breaking down long academic texts into digestible learning materials.


# Key Features

### 1. Topic Input / Note Pasting

Users can type or paste long academic notes directly into the input box.

### 3. Multiple AI Processing Modes

Users can choose one or more actions:

* Explain
* Summarize
* Generate Quiz

### 4. Responsive Output Panels

* AI Explanation Panel: Displays generated summaries or explanations
* Quiz Panel: Displays generated quiz questions with options

### 5. Fast & Lightweight UI
The interface is simple, mobile-responsive, and easy to navigate.


# Tech Stack

### Frontend

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

### Backend

* Node.js
* Express.js
* pdf-parse (for PDF extraction)

### AI Integration

Supports either:
* OpenAI GPT Models
* Google Gemini AI

(Backend routes are designed to allow plugging in either provider.)


# How It Works

### 1. User provides input

* Text or PDF
* Selects desired actions (Explain / Summarize / Quiz)

### 2. Backend extracts content (if PDF)

PDF text is parsed into plain text.

### 3. AI Model generates response

The backend calls OpenAI or Gemini API with a structured prompt.

### 4. Output displayed

Results appear in the Explanation and/or Quiz panels based on user selections.



# Future Enhancements

* User accounts + Dashboard
* Save summaries and quizzes
* Multi-language support
* Offline/low-data mode

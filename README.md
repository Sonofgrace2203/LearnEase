# Project Overview

LearnEase is a web-based academic assistant designed to make learning simple. Students can paste text, upload PDF notes, or type a topic. The system uses AI (Hugging face, OpenAI or Gemini mode) to generate:

* ✔ Explanations
* ✔ Summaries
* ✔ Quiz Questions

It reduces study time and improves retention by breaking down long academic texts into digestible learning materials.


# Key Features

### 1. Topic Input / Note Pasting
Users can type or paste long academic notes directly into the input box.

### 2. PDF Note Upload
Students can upload PDF documents containing lecture notes or class materials.

### 3. Multiple AI Processing Modes
Users can choose one or more actions:
    * Explain
    * Summarize
    * Generate Quiz

### 4. Responsive Output Panels
    * AI Explanation Panel: Displays generated summaries or explanations
    * Quiz Panel: Displays generated quiz questions

### 5. Fast & Lightweight UI
The interface is simple, mobile-responsive, and easy to navigate.


# Tech Stack

### Frontend
    * HTML
    * CSS
    * JavaScript

### Backend
    * Node.js
    * Express.js
    * Mongodb Atlas

### AI Integration
Supports either:
    * Hugging face Model
    * OpenAI GPT Models
    * Google Gemini AI


# How It Works

### 1. User provides input
    * Text or PDF
    * Selects desired actions (Explain / Summarize / Quiz)

### 2. Backend extracts content (if PDF)
    PDF text is parsed into plain text.

### 4. Output displayed
Results appear in the Explanation and/or Quiz panels based on user selections.
